## 🛑 STOP: Read This Before You Do Anything Else

> ### 1️⃣ Read the whole `README.md` first
> The `README.md` in this repository contains the full instructions: class descriptions, feature specifications, question prompts and the video script. **If you skip it, you will lose marks.**
>
> ### 2️⃣ Understand the full code before answering any question
> Open `SchedulerSimulation.java` and read it **from top to bottom**. You must be able to explain what `Process`, `run()`, `runToCompletion()`, `addProcessToQueue()`, `Thread.start()`, `Thread.join()` and `Thread.sleep()` do **before** you write a single answer in Parts B and C. Run the program at least once and watch the output.
>
> ### 3️⃣ Commit many times, not once
> A single commit, or all commits made in the last hour, costs you **-0.5 mark**. See the [Commit Rules](#-commit-rules-mandatory) below.

**How to use this file:**
1. Fill in your **Student Information** (below) right now.

## 🔁 Commit Rules (MANDATORY)

> ### ⚠️ MANY COMMITS ARE REQUIRED. A single bulk commit is penalized (-0.5 mark).

**Minimum: 3 meaningful commits. Aim for 6 or more.**

| # | Commit | Example message |
|:-:|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Student ID set | `Set my student ID: 441234567` |
| 2 | Feature 1: Priority | `Feature 1: Added priority field to Process class` |
| 3 | Feature 2: Context switches | `Feature 2: Implemented context switch counter` |
| 4 | Feature 3: Waiting time | `Feature 3: Added waiting time tracking and summary table` |
| 5 | Development log entries | `Docs: Added development log entries 1-3` |
| 6 | Reflection and answers | `Docs: Completed reflection and technical answers` |
| 7 | Video link | `Docs: Added demo video link` |

**Rules:**
- ✅ **One commit per feature.** Do not put all three features in one commit.
- ✅ **Commit after each work session**, and after each part of this file.
- ✅ **Spread your commits over different dates.** Not all in one day.
- ❌ **Do not make all commits in the last hour** before the deadline.
- ❌ **No vague messages** like `done`, `update` or `final version`.

> 💡 **TIP:** Your commit history is checked and you **show it in your video** (at least 3 commits visible). Your development log dates should match your commit dates.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** **Use VS Code** (see *Recommended Development Environment* in `README.md` for the full setup). Sign in to GitHub in VS Code, then commit from the Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G) → stage → write a message → Commit → Sync/Push. You can edit and commit this file the same way. **Pushing** matters: commits that are not pushed to GitHub are invisible to the instructor.

# Part A: Development Log (0.5 mark)

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Minimum **5 entries**, spread over **different dates**. Five entries written on the same day, or written all at once at the end, will lose marks and look like a copy. Entry dates should be **between the start of the assignment and the deadline (October 10, 2026)**.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Write an entry at the **end of each work session**, while you still remember what happened. It takes 5 minutes.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Be specific. "Worked on the code" is a weak entry. "Added a `static int contextSwitches` counter and incremented it before `currentThread.start()`" is a strong one.
>
> 📌 **NOTE:** Each entry needs: date and time, what you did, details, challenges, solution, and time spent. Real challenges are fine (and expected). Do not invent fake ones.

## Your Development Log

### Entry 1 - [october3,2026.1:14 ]
**What I did**:
Added my student ID to the project
**Details**:
SchedulerSimulation.java, updated the student ID on line 150 to my actual ID, compiled the code, and made sure it runs successfully without any errors.
**Challenges**:
Had to check where the student ID variable was located inside the main simulation file.
**Solution**:
Searched for the studentID variable and replaced the placeholder with my university ID, then pushed the first commit.
**Time spent**:
25 minutes
---

### Entry 2 - [october3,2026.2:39]
**What I did**:
Implemented the process priority feature.
**Details**:
Added a random priority field ranging from 1 to 10 for each process and printed it out whenever a process enters the ready queue while maintaining the standard FIFO order.
**Challenges**:
Making sure the priority assignment did not disrupt the existing FIFO queue behavior.
**Solution**:
Generated a random number between 1 and 10 and logged the priority value inside the process creation/queue logic
**Time spent**:
 40minutes
---

### Entry 3 - [october3,2026.3:59]
**What I did**:
Added the context switch counter feature.
**Details**:
Created a static counter variable that increases by one every single time a new process starts its execution, and printed the final total sum at the end of the simulation.
**Challenges**:
Figuring out where to increment the counter so it accurately reflects every actual switch.
**Solution**:
Placed the increment statement right before starting the thread execution block so it tracks every context switch properly.
**Time spent**:
35minutes
---

### Entry 4 - [october3,2026.5:12]
**What I did**:
Implemented waiting time tracking and the final summary table.
**Details**:
Used System.currentTimeMillis() to track and calculate waiting times, and generated a clean final execution summary table showing the process name, burst time, waiting time, and turnaround time.
**Challenges**:
Formatting the final table so that the calculations and numbers align neatly in the console output.
**Solution**:
Calculated turnaround time as waiting time plus burst time, and printed the formatted results table at the simulation finish point.

# Part B: Reflection (0.5 mark)

> 🛑 **STOP:** Do **not** start this part until you have read the `README.md`, read the **entire** `SchedulerSimulation.java`, run it, and finished the three features.
>
> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Each answer must be **5 to 7 sentences**, in **your own words**. Copied or AI-generated answers without understanding get **0 marks for the whole assignment**. You may be asked to explain them in person.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Mention concrete things you actually did: a method you wrote, an error you hit, a line of output you saw. Generic answers score low.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Draft your answer in a few bullet points first, then turn them into sentences.

## Question 1: What did you learn about multithreading?

> 💡 **TIP:** Talk about thread creation (`Runnable`, `Thread.start()`), waiting with `Thread.join()`, simulating work with `Thread.sleep()`, and what surprised you.

**Your Answer:** *(5-7 sentences)*

[I learned how to create threads using the Runnable interface and start them with Thread.start(). I also practiced managing synchronization and waiting for threads to finish using Thread.join(). Using Thread.sleep() helped me realistically simulate CPU work and time delays. It was amazing to see how multiple processes run concurrently and how the OS manages them]

## Question 2: What was the most challenging part of this assignment?

> 💡 **TIP:** Pick **one** specific challenge (understanding the code, one of the features, Git, the video) and say *why* it was hard.

**Your Answer:** *(5-7 sentences)*

[The hardest part was managing the timing logic and tracking waiting times accurately for each process. Ensuring the context switch counter incremented correctly right before execution required careful debugging. Tracing the scheduler's flow step-by-step took time to understand fully. Overcoming this required testing small code changes continuously]

## Question 3: How did you overcome the challenges you faced?

> 💡 **TIP:** Describe your method: reading documentation, adding `System.out.println` to debug, re-reading the README, testing after each small change, asking for help.

**Your Answer:** *(5-7 sentences)*

[I overcame the challenges by following a step-by-step debugging approach. First, I re-read the assignment instructions carefully to understand the required behavior. Then, I used System.out.println statements to trace queue updates and monitor variables. Testing my code after every small change helped me isolate and fix errors quickly.]

## Question 4: How can you apply multithreading concepts in real-world applications?

> 💡 **TIP:** Use real applications you know (web browser, game, mobile app, music player) and connect each one to what you built here.

**Your Answer:** *(5-7 sentences)*

[Multithreading is widely used in software to improve performance and user responsiveness. For example, web browsers use separate threads for downloading files and rendering pages simultaneously. Mobile apps use background threads for network requests to keep the user interface smooth. Understanding scheduling algorithms helps in writing efficient concurrent code]

### Optional: What would you like to learn more about?

[Any topics related to threading or operating systems that you're curious about?]

### Optional: How confident do you feel about multithreading concepts now?

[Beginner / Intermediate / Confident. What do you understand well? What needs more practice?]

### Optional: Feedback on the assignment

[Any comments? Was it helpful? Too easy or hard? Suggestions?]

# Part C: Technical Answers (0.5 mark)

> 🛑 **STOP:** You cannot answer these questions without understanding the code. Re-read `SchedulerSimulation.java` and **run it** first. Your answers must reference **your own code and your own output** (your student ID makes your output unique).
>
> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Each answer must be **3 to 5 sentences**, with specific examples from your code or output. Use correct terms: thread, process, time quantum, ready queue, context switch, burst time.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Keep your program output in a text file or screenshot so you can copy real snippets for Question 2.

## Question 1: Thread vs Process

**Question**: Explain the difference between a **thread** and a **process**. Why did we use threads in this assignment instead of creating separate processes? Mention at least **TWO** specific differences (e.g., memory sharing, creation overhead, communication speed), and reference relevant parts of `SchedulerSimulation.java`.

> 💡 **TIP:** Note that the class named `Process` in our code is a *simulated* process, and it is run by a real Java *thread*. Explain that distinction and point to the `new Thread(process)` line in `addProcessToQueue()`.

**Your Answer:** *(3-5 sentences)*

[A process has an independent memory space, while a thread is a lightweight execution unit that shares memory within a process. We used Java threads because they share memory efficiently and have low overhead. In SchedulerSimulation.java, Process is a simulated process driven by a real Java thread. This allows the scheduler to easily simulate multitasking within a single application.]

## Question 2: Ready Queue Behavior

**Question**: In Round-Robin scheduling, what happens when a process doesn't finish within its time quantum? Explain using an example from **your** program output, including **how many times that process was re-queued** before it finished, and explain why re-queueing matters for fairness.

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** The output snippet must come from **your own run** (with your student ID), not from a classmate or from this README.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Pick a process with a large burst time (e.g., more than 2 × time quantum) and count how many "added to ready queue" lines it has after the first one. Search your console for its name (e.g., `P3`).

**Your Answer:** *(3-5 sentences)*

[If a process does not finish within its time quantum, its remaining burst time decreases, and it is re-queued back into the ready queue. For example, a process with a large burst time shows multiple entries like: Process P1 added to ready queue, burst time remaining: 3 This ensures fairness by pausing long processes to give others CPU time.]

Example from my output:
```
[Paste a relevant snippet from your program output here showing a process being re-queued]
```

**Explanation of example:**
[Explain what is happening in the output snippet you pasted.]

## Question 3: Thread Lifecycle

**Question**: A thread goes through these states: **New**, **Runnable**, **Running**, **Waiting**, **Terminated**. Walk through these states for one process (e.g., P1) from your simulation. For each state, explain **when** P1 enters it and **which line or method call** triggers the transition (`Thread.start()`, `Thread.join()`, `Thread.sleep()`, etc.).

> 💡 **TIP:** Follow P1 through the code: created in `addProcessToQueue()`, started in the scheduler loop, sleeping inside `run()`, and the main thread waiting on `join()`. Remember that **the main thread waits** on `join()`, while **P1's thread sleeps** in `Thread.sleep()`. Be clear about which thread is in which state.

**Your Answer:** *(3-5 sentences overall; one short explanation per state)*

1. **New**: []P1 enters this state when the process object is newly instantiated in memory before its thread is initialized

2. **Runnable**: [P1 becomes runnable when it is added to the ready queue using the addProcessToQueue() method, waiting for CPU scheduling]

3. **Running**: [P1 transitions to the running state when the scheduler loop selects it and triggers Thread.start() to begin execution]

4. **Waiting**: [P1's thread enters a waiting or sleeping state while executing its task inside the run() method using Thread.sleep()]

5. **Terminated**: [P1 becomes terminated once its execution finishes completely, and the main thread waits for its completion using Thread.join()]

## Question 4: Real-World Applications

**Question**: Give **TWO** real-world examples where Round-Robin scheduling with threads would be useful. **At least one** must be an operating-system-level scenario (e.g., how an OS scheduler shares CPU time among running programs). The second can be any application you choose. For each, explain what the system is and **why Round-Robin fits** (fairness, responsiveness, predictability).

> 💡 **TIP:** Relate each example back to your simulation: what plays the role of the "process", the "time quantum" and the "context switch" in that scenario?

**Your Answer:** *(3-5 sentences per example)*

### Example 1 (operating-system level): [CPU Time-Sharing]

**Description**:
[An OS CPU scheduler allocates short time slices to multiple active applications running on a computer system]

**Why Round-Robin works well here**:
[The "process" is an active application window, the "time quantum" is the CPU slice granted by the kernel, and the "context switch" is saving the current app state. Round-Robin guarantees fairness, high responsiveness, and predictable]

### Example 2: [Network Printer Spooler]

**Description**:
[A central network print server that receives and schedules multiple print jobs simultaneously from different users]

**Why Round-Robin works well here**:
[The "process" is the document file being printed, the "time quantum" is the allocated page processing time slice, and the "context switch" is pausing one print job to process another. Round-Robin works exceptionally well here because it ensures absolute fairness, preventing a single huge document from hogging the printer and allowing all users to get their pages printed promptly]

## Summary

**Key concepts I understood through these questions:**
1. Multithreading concepts and thread lifecycle states.
2. CPU scheduling and Round-Robin algorithm behavior.
3. How to measure performance metrics using time functions.

**Concepts I need to study more:**
1. Advanced thread synchronization and deadlock prevention.
2. Performance optimization and process waiting time calculations.
